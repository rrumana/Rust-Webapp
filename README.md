# Rust-Webapp

This is an implementation of the a Rust webserver as shown in the Rust book final chapters.

I am planning on hosting my own portfolio website which is running on rust, even if the frontend is using a more modern software stack.

Update November 2024:

I am going to be parking this repository in place for now. I am currently building my portfolio website in a different repository called portfolio. This repo was usefull for exploring error handling, message passing, multithreading, and Rust in general, but I have moved on to other things.
