# Rust-Webapp

This is an implementation of the a Rust webserver as shown in the Rust book final chapters.

This is going to be a starting off point and a template for further exploration into webapp coding.

I am planning on hosting my own portfolio website which is running on rust, even if the frontend is using a more modern software stack.
