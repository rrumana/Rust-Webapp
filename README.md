# Rust-Webapp

This is an implementation of the a Rust webserver as shown in the Rust book final chapters.

This is going to be a starting off point and a template for further exploration into webapp coding.

The current plan is to revisit this project down the road to build upon this knowlege and build a good front end.

I may try to make a portfolio website in the event that I learn enough Javascript and whatnot, but that currently isn't in the cards as I am enjoying writing other projects in Rust.
